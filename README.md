# GUI-visualizer-MOS

This is a GUI simulator for MOS capacitors. Following is the demo for the same. 

![simulator](./demo/MOS-cap-simulator.gif)

### Instructions

1. **Run the code**

```matlab
% Execute the following in matlab terminal.
% Switch directory to src
cd src
% Run the simulator
simulator
```

2. **Derivation of Surface potential**

   I have provided derivation to calculating the surface potential (when depletion width is unknown) used in the code in the derivation folder.  

   

### To do

- [ ] Simulate the accumulation mode for both p and n substrate MOS capacitor
